##Got the first choice done! Re-learned how to use functions, particularly how to call global variables in and out of functions. Macgyvered a way to repeat 
##a function as well. I should probably start putting some comments into this code.

    "overpowered you and had her dagger on your neck waiting for the final blow.\n")
